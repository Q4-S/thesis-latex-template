%%     app.tex, to be compiled with xelatex	     %%
%%   Inspired by Chonnam National University     %%
%% Support one or two-sided, Korean/Hangeul font %%
%%      Fully customizable ToC, LoF, LoT		 %%
%%          Just modify as necessary	         %%	 
% =================================================
% IMPORTANT: xelatex NEEDED as default compiler (magic command in first top line tries to use the correct compiler automatically, usually for an offline compiler, but it does not always work well)
% It is NOT using PDFLaTeX, better you learn how to change the compiler first, for example: from Overleaf menu/settings
% Alternative compiler: LuaLaTeX (it is based on the packages list activated, such as fontspec, kotex, etc)
% List of Contents of this template uses Bahasa Indonesia (you can change any detail in setting.tex)
% FREE to use, modify and distribute anytime, see my github page to contribute
% Made with dedicated pleasure and love in 2025, by Q. Alief S.

\documentclass[12pt, a4paper,
               %openright,
               oneside]
               {report}
% Options: letterpaper, a4paper, legalpaper or custom-size in setting.tex
% openright only worked for two-sided to make a new chapter always on the right side
% Options: oneside or twoside (If you want to try twoside, it is better also to activate openright)
% If you change 'report' to 'book'-twoside, it is almost similar to 'report'-twoside + openright

% === documentclass options explanation ===
% article: Short papers, journal articles, assignments (no chapters)
% report: Theses, dissertations, technical reports (has chapters, one-sided default)
% book: Published books, very long theses (have chapters, two-sided default, left/right pages, no abstract command, have \frontmatter, \mainmatter, \backmatter commands)

% === Note: ===
% Originally, it was only one tex file, then I divided it to make a clear explanation.
% Next, you can create some folders or change your own for better file organization using the command: \input, \include, etc

\input{setting.tex}     % ORGANIZE PACKAGES AND STYLES
